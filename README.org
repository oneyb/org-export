*org-export*: batch export of org-mode files from the command line

* Overview

Emacs [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] is a markup language for "keeping notes, maintaining
TODO lists, planning projects, and authoring documents" - but most
importantly (to me) it's a platform for literate programming and
reproducible research. [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Babel]] supports the creation of documents with
interleaved code (eg, R, Python, shell, sqlite, elisp, etc) and
text. The code may be evaluated and the results incorporated into the
document. One limitation is that org-mode is primarily oriented toward
interactive compilation of documents via emacs. This project provides
tools for non-interactive compilation of org-mode files. Why is this
useful?

- Not everyone uses emacs (/gasp!/), but everyone should be able to
  create documents using org-mode!
- Document generation can be fully scripted (eg, as the final step in
  an analysis pipeline).
- Interactively-compiled documents depend on an individual user's
  emacs configuration, which can produce different results for
  different users; these scripts manage all dependencies from elpa
  independently of the users' own emacs config. By default, a new
  folder is created in =~/.org-export= the first time a script is
  executed, and dependencies (such as the most recent version of
  org-mode) are installed.
- These scripts also provide some conveniences with respect to
  providing css styles.

* Installation and use

First, clone this repository and enter the cloned directory. There are
a few options for installing and invoking the =org-export= entry point
to a location on your =$PATH= (we'll use =/usr/local/bin= as an example):

- Recommended: use a link. This method allows you to update
=org-export= with a git-pull from the git repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ln org-export *.el /usr/local/bin
# or:
ln -s org-export /usr/local/bin
#+END_SRC

- Copy the files:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cp org-export *.el /usr/local/bin
#+END_SRC

- Invoke using the absolute path to =org-export= within the cloned git repository.

Execute the script with =-h= to see usage and available commands:

#+NAME: cli-help
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :exports both :eval yes
org-export -h
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: cli-help
#+begin_example
Usage: org-export command options...

Available commands include:
  cli
  html
  koma
  odt
  pdf
  pelican
  tangle
#+end_example


If all of the scripts are on your $PATH, you should be able to execute using:

: org-export html --infile ...

You may need to explicitly identify the emacs binary using the =EMACS=
environment variable; for example on OS X:

: EMACS=/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs org-export html --infile ...

*** org-mode, el-get, and certificate errors

*tl;dr*: install libressl using homebrew if you see errors on a Mac
about TLS certificates.

The full story:

As of emacs 25, a few new issues emerged:

=package.el= began to refuse to install =org-mode=
non-interactively. This may be related to the known issue in which
=package-installed-p= always returns =t= for built-in packages (see,
for example [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/issues/319][this issue]]).

In attempting to use =el-get= as an alternative mechanism for
installing packages, I found that a certificate error (using MacOS
10.11) prevented downloads from github. Thanks to [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/18045][this]] answer on
StackExchange, I was able to provide a workaround. The workaround
requires installation of libressl using homebrew, and
assumes the default installation in =/usr/local=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
brew update
brew install libressl
brew install emacs --with-gnutls
brew linkapps emacs
#+END_SRC

Here are the lines in =cli-el-get-setup()= that implement the fix:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :eval no
(require 'gnutls)
(setq gnutls-verify-error t)
(add-to-list 'gnutls-trustfiles "/usr/local/etc/libressl/cert.pem")
#+END_SRC

*** known issues

- Installation of org-mode fails on Ubuntu 12.04 using emacs 25.
- =ess= fails to compile without R installed.

* Commands
*** org-export html

Exports org-mode to html

Command line arguments:

#+NAME: html-help
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :exports both :eval yes
./org-export html -h
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
Using /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs, GNU Emacs 25.1.91.1
Command line options:

 --infile       path to input .org file (required)
 --outfile      path to output .html file (use base name of infile by default)
 --evaluate     evaluate source code blocks
 --css          path or URL of css stylesheet
 --embed-css    Include contents of css in a <style> block
 --bootstrap    make Bootstrap-specific modifications to html output;
                        if selected, link to Bootstrap CDN by default
 --package-dir  directory containing elpa packages
 --verbose      enable debugging message on error


Note that code block evaluation is disabled by default; use
'--evaluate' to set a default value of ':eval yes' for all code
blocks. If you would like to evaluate by default without requiring
this option, include '#+PROPERTY: header-args :eval yes' in the file
header. Individual blocks can be selectively evaluated using ':eval
yes' in the block header.

#+end_example

The simplest invocation is as follows (you can test this out using this document):

: org-export html --infile README.org

If you want to provide css styles using [[http://getbootstrap.com/][Bootstrap]] (inserts a link to the Bootstrap CDN):

: org-export html --infile README.org --bootstrap

You can also embed the css content in a =<style>= block - this is
useful if you want to distribute a file and don't want to assume that
the user's environment will support linking to the css file.

: org-export html --infile README.org --bootstrap --embed-css

It's also easy to link to or embed alternative css stylesheets, for
example, the ones used by the org-mode manual:

: org-export html --infile README.org --css http://orgmode.org/org-manual.css --embed-css
